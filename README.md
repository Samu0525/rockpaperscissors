Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Developed a fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

user inputs, and real-time results. It demonstrates my ability to create responsive designs and 
implement JavaScript logic to handle game rules, user choices, and score tracking.
